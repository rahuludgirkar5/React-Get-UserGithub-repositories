# github-users-react

A simple React application that consumes GitHub API. This project also uses [Material UI][1] for UI components, [axios][2] to do http requests, [redux][3] for app state management, [redux-saga][4] to deal with side-effects and [reach-router][5] to create app routes.

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app][6] and it also available on [Heroku][7].
